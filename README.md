[Problem 18](https://www.beecrowd.com.br/judge/en/problems/view/1957): Data stored in computers are in binary. An economic way of visualizing these numbers is the usage of base 16 (hexadecimal).Your task is to write a program that, given a natural number at base 10, shows its representation in hexadecimal.
[Problem 19](https://www.beecrowd.com.br/judge/en/problems/view/1016): Two cars (X and Y) leave in the same direction. The car X leaves with a constant speed of 60 km/h and the car Y leaves with a constant speed of 90 km / h.In one hour (60 minutes) the car Y can get a distance of 30 kilometers from the X car, in other words, it can get away one kilometer for each 2 minutes.
Read the distance (in km) and calculate how long it takes (in minutes) for the car Y to take this distance in relation to the other car.
